# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project, at least loosely, adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file contains the unreleased changes to the codebase. See CHANGELOG.md for
the released changes.

## Unreleased
### Changed
- Moved `get_derived_params` to `timing_model`
- `check_ephemeris_connection` CI test no longer requires access to static NANOGrav site
- `TimingModel.compare()` now calls `change_binary_epoch()`.
- When clock files contain out-of-order entries, the exception now records the first MJDs that are out of order
- `np.compat.long` -> `int` (former is deprecated)
- Turned ErfaWarning into an exception during testing; cleaned up test suite.
- macos-latest runner changed to macos-12 runner for CI tests to avoid M1 architecture issues
### Added
- Added numdifftools to setup.cfg to match requirements.txt
- Documentation: Added `convert_parfile` to list of command-line tools in RTD
- DDH binary model
- function `pint.utils.xxxselections` to do DMX-style selections for any parameter name
- Plot model DM in pintk
- More tests for pintk
- Maximum likelihood fitting for ECORR
    - `is_time_correlated` class attribute in correlated `NoiseComponent`s
    - `has_time_correlated_errors` property in `TimingModel`
    - `Residuals._calc_ecorr_chi2()` method for fast chi2 computation using Sherman-Morrison identity
    - `pint.utils.sherman_morrison_dot` and `pint.utils.woodbury_dot`
    - Refactored repeated code out of `Residuals.calc_phase_mean` and `Residuals.calc_time_mean`
    - Simplified `Residuals._calc_gls_chi2()` so that it uses Woodbury identity directly
    - Refactored WLS chi2 code out of `Residuals.calc_chi2()` into a new function `Residuals._calc_wls_chi2()`
    - `Residuals.d_lnlikelihood_d_whitenoise_param` will throw a `NotImplementedError` when correlated noise is present.
    - `DownhillFitter._fit_noise()` doesn't use derivatives when correlated noise is present.
    - Documentation: Noise fitting example notebook.
- `freeze_params` option in `wavex_setup` and `dmwavex_setup`
- `plrednoise_from_wavex`, `pldmnoise_from_dmwavex`, and `find_optimal_nharms` functions
- fake TOAs can be created with `subtract_mean=False`, to maintain phase coherence between different data sets
- Binary models can be guessed by the `ModelBuilder`. Options and script are added to allow reading/conversion of the T2 binary model
- Better explanation of ELL1H behavior when H3/H4/STIGMA supplied and when NHARMS is used
- FDJumpDM component for System-dependent DM offsets
- Documentation: Explanation for FDJUMP and FDJUMPDM
### Fixed
- `MCMC_walkthrough` notebook now runs
- Fixed runtime data README 
- Fixed `derived_params` when OMDOT has 0 uncertainty
- `model.find_empty_masks` will now also look at DMX and SWX parameters
- Fixed `make_fake_toas_fromtim`
- Use `Hessian` instead of `Hessdiag` in `DownhillFitter._fit_noise`; compute noise parameter uncertainties only once in `DownhillFitter.fit_toas`.
- Consistent naming in `TimingModel.get_params_mapping()`
- Better exceptions for unsupported/unimplemented binary models (BTX, MSS, etc.)
- Emit warnings when `WaveX`/`DMWaveX` is used together with other representations of red/DM noise
- `get_observatory()` no longer overwrites `include_gps` and `include_bipm` of `Observatory` objects unless explicitly stated (BIPM and GPS clock corrections no longer incorrectly applied to BAT TOAs).
- Added back `spacecraft` as an alias for `stl_geo`
- Fix bug 1729 (missing f-string)
- Fixed common failure of test_observatory
- pintk now shows scaled error bars
- Docstring of `DispersionJump`
### Removed
