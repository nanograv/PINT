class MCMCSampler:
    """Base class for samplers used in MCMC fitting.

    The sampling method should be implemented in the run_mcmc() method.

    This was created initially to work with the emcee package but can
    be extended for other samplers.

    The use of this class can be somewhat tricky, since MCMCFitter must
    own some subclass of the abstract class MCMCSampler. However, the
    MCMCSampler requires access to functions inside MCMCFitter. So the
    specific MCMCSampler must be instantiated first and passed into
    the Fitter, but the Sampler cannot be initialized until after the Fitter
    has been created.

    The general flow of using the MCMCSampler class with MCMCFitter is::
        #Create the sampler object but don't intialize the internals
        sampler = MCMCSampler()

        #Create the fitter using the new sampler
        fitter = MCMCFitter(...stuff..., sampler=sampler)
