Clock correction files
======================

These clock correction files need to be updated to cover any time you want precision timing for. Ideally one would obtain these from a standard location provided by the observatory, but one can often obtain reasonably recent versions from the TEMPO source repository at https://sourceforge.net/p/tempo/tempo/ci/master/tree/clock/ .

Observatory locations:
