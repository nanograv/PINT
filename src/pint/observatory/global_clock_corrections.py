"""Tools for working with clock corrections obtained from a global location.

The goal is for PINT (and other programs) to be able to download up-to-date
observatory clock corrections from a central location, which observatories
or third parties will update as new clock correction data becomes available.

The global repository is currently hosted on github. Available clock correction
files and their updating requirements are listed in a file there called index.txt.
This too is checked occasionally for updates.

The downloaded files are stored in the Astropy cache,
to clear out old files you will want to do
``astropy.utils.data.clear_download_cache()``.
