class ClockFile:
    """A clock correction file.

    The ClockFile class provides a way to read various formats of clock
    files.  It will provide the clock information from the file as arrays
    of times and clock correction values via the ClockFile.time and
    ClockFile.clock properties.  The file should be initially read using the
    ClockFile.read() method, for example:

        >>> cf = ClockFile.read(os.getenv('TEMPO')+'/clock/time_gbt.dat')
        >>> print cf.time
        [ 51909.5  51910.5  51911.5 ...,  57475.5  57476.5  57477.5]
        >>> print cf.clock
        [-3.14  -3.139 -3.152 ...,  0.179  0.185  0.188] us

    Or:

        >>> cf = ClockFile.read(os.getenv('TEMPO2')+'/clock/gbt2gps.clk',
                                    format='tempo2')
        >>> print cf.time
        [ 51909.5  51910.5  51911.5 ...,  57411.5  57412.5  57413.5]
        >>> print cf.clock
        [ -3.14000000e-06  -3.13900000e-06  -3.15200000e-06 ...,   1.80000000e-08
           2.10000000e-08   2.30000000e-08] s

    Clock correction file objects preserve the comments in the original file,
    and can be written in TEMPO or TEMPO2 format.

    If you want to provide a new clock correction file format, you should
    write a function that can read it and return an appropriate ClockFile
    object. It should take a filename, Path, or file-like object as its
    first argument, and probably at least a ``friendly_name`` keyword argument.
    You would then add it to ``ClockFile._formats`` as something like
    ``ClockFile._formats["haiku"] = my_read_haiku_function``. Then
    ``ClockFile.read(filename, format="haiku", ...)`` will call
    ``my_read_haiku_function(filename, ...)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mjd : np.ndarray
        The MJDs at which clock corrections are measured
    clock : astropy.units.Quantity
        The clock corrections at those MJDs (units of time)
    comments : list of str or None
        The comments following each clock correction; should match ``mjd``
        and ``clock`` in length. If not provided, a list of empty comments
        is used. The first line of these strings are normally on the same
        line as the corresponding clock correction, while any subsequent
        lines occur between it and the next and should probably start with
        ``# ``.
    leading_comment : str
        A comment to put at the top of the file. Lines should probably start
        with ``# ``.
    filename : str or None
        If present, a file that can be read to reproduce this data.
    friendly_name : str or None
        A descriptive file name, in case the filename is long or uninformative.
        If not provided defaults to the filename.
    header : str
        A header to include, if output in TEMPO2 format.
