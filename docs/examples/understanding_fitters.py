# There are several fitters in PINT, each of which is a subclass of `Fitter`
#
# * `WLSFitter` - PINT's workhorse fitter, which does a basic weighted least-squares minimization of the residuals.
# * `GLSFitter` - A generalized least squares fitter, like "tempo -G", that can handle noise processes like ECORR and red noise that are specified by their correlation function properties.
# * `PowellFitter` - A very simple example fitter that uses the Powell method implemented in scipy. One notable feature is that it does not require evaluating derivatives w.r.t the model parameters.
# * `MCMCFitter` - A fitter that does an MCMC fit using the [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package. This can be very slow, but accomodates Priors on the parameter values and can produce corner plots and other analyses of the posterior distributions of the parameters.

# ## Weighted Least Squares Fitter

# %%
# Instantiate a fitter
wlsfit = pint.fitter.WLSFitter(toas=t, model=m)

# %% [markdown]
# A fit is performed by calling `fit_toas()`
#
# For most fitters, multiple iterations can be done by setting the `maxiter` keyword argument
#
# The return value of most fitters is the final chi^2 value

# %%
wlsfit.fit_toas(maxiter=1)

# %%
# A summary of the fit and resulting model parameters can easily be printed
# Only free parameters will have values and uncertainties in the Postfit column
wlsfit.print_summary()

# %%
# The WLS fitter doesn't handle correlated errors
wlsfit.resids.model.has_correlated_errors

# %%
# You can request a pretty-printed covariance matrix
cov = wlsfit.get_parameter_covariance_matrix(pretty_print=True)

# %%
# plot() will make a plot of the post-fit residuals
wlsfit.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Powell fitter
#
# The Powell fitter takes much longer to run! It also doesn't find quite as good of a minimum as the WLS fitter.
#
# This uses scipy's modification of Powellâ€™s method, which is a conjugate direction method. It performs sequential one-dimensional minimizations along each vector of the directions, which is updated at each iteration of the main minimization loop. The function need not be differentiable, and no derivatives are taken.
#
# The default number of iterations is 20, but this can be changed with the `maxiter` parameter

# %%
powfit = pint.fitter.PowellFitter(toas=t, model=m)

# %%
powfit.fit_toas()

# %%
powfit.print_summary()

# %% [markdown]
# ***!!! Note that the Powell fitter does not produce a covariance matrix or estimates of the uncertainties. !!!***
#
# ## Comparing models
#
# There also a convenience function for pretty printing a comparison of two models with the differences measured in sigma.

# %%
print(wlsfit.model.compare(powfit.model))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Generalized Least Squares fitter
#
# The GLS fitter is capable of handling correlated noise models.
#
# It has some more complex options using the `maxiter`, `threshold`, and `full_cov` keyword arguments to `fit_toas()`.
#
# If `maxiter` is less than one, **no fitting is done**, just the
# chi-squared computation. In this case, you must provide the `residuals`
# argument.
#
# If `maxiter` is one or more, so fitting is actually done, the
# chi-squared value returned is only approximately the chi-squared
# of the improved(?) model. In fact it is the chi-squared of the
# solution to the linear fitting problem, and the full non-linear
# model should be evaluated and new residuals produced if an accurate
# chi-squared is desired.
#
# A first attempt is made to solve the fitting problem by Cholesky
# decomposition, but if this fails singular value decomposition is
# used instead. In this case singular values below threshold are removed.
#
# `full_cov` determines which calculation is used. If True, the full
# covariance matrix is constructed and the calculation is relatively
# straightforward but the full covariance matrix may be enormous.
# If False, an algorithm is used that takes advantage of the structure
# of the covariance matrix, based on information provided by the noise
# model. The two algorithms should give the same result to numerical
# accuracy where they both can be applied.
