This section is to provide detailed solutions to particular problems.
Some of these are based on user questions, others are more about how to develop PINT.
Please feel free to change this by writing more; there are also some entries on the 
`PINT wiki <https://github.com/nanograv/PINT/wiki/How-To>`_ which you can contribute to more directly.
