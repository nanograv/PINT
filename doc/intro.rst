Introduction to PINT
====================

PINT stands for Pint Is Not Tempo3. It is a tool for precision pulsar timing, 
the process of using the measured arrival times of pulses from pulsars to fit 
astrometric, orbital, and spin-down parameters. For a description of the 
process, see the "Handbook of Pulsar Astronomy" by Lorimer and Kramer. This 
program is intended to fill the roles of the existing programs TEMPO and 
TEMPO2, but it should be easier to extend and modify, and it should serve as a 
re-implementation that can be used to verify their correctness.
