# This file is a list of aliases for observatories.
# Each line lists the aliases for a single observatory, the short code for
# which is the first word on the line. One or more aliases may be listed for
# each observatory.
#
# These aliases differ from the tempo aliases because there are too many 
# observatories and different sites were added differently at times.
#
# If you need to use tempo site codes, try setting TEMPO2_ALIAS="tempo"
